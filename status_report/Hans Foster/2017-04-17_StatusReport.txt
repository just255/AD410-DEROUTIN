1)  We discussed in detail survey JS and how the Json file will be a single chunk of code which the front end can manipulate to create any kind of reports on the TIP forms
    for admins and whatnot.  

2)  Just need to confirm that the DB will save only the Json file, this might be an issue later - we can create code to parse through the code at some point.  

3)  We need to be better at deciding exactly what we're doing before attempting code I think?  This means communicating directly with front and back end asap about using 
    survey JS code and Json.  But all is going well.
