1)  First realized I had not been doing status reports (I had thought they were limited to peer reviews), then found out I didn't have access to merge, but looks like the 
problem was resolved (updated 5/2/17)

2)  Will work with Joseph on creating a php mail script so that users can email through this canvas application

3)  Just need to complete status reports and do my best to remember what happened.
