1)  Leaving over the weekend, confirmed that we're going to try using laravel, had a good discussion in class and saw all the mockups.  Contributed
    opinions on design.  

2)  Unfortunately I won't be able to work much during the next 3 days due to being out of town, but will read about laravel

3)  Need more concrete meeting times - I think Thursday an hour before class and Monday at 5 will be our regular times.
