1)  Just met in class, didn't have the time to look at things in detail.  Learned that the ERD and Json file splitter
are coming along.  

2)  Haven't met since last time, hopefully will Monday.  

3)  Coordination with meeting times and assigning tasks, but it's no big deal we're on the same page!
