Status Report #8

Mid-Tier Team

1. After having the meeting with whole group, it was great to get
clarification on certain aspects of the UI, along with the work that mid-tier
will have on the horizon.

2. Had initial discussions with Joseph & Niko about parsing the JSON object
to store individual questions, along with planning for meetings to come before
the second sprint.

3. Potentially difficult to meet with most of the group, hope to be able to
communicate user story assignments effectively. Parsing/manipulating the JSON
to store individual questions may take a bit of time.
