Mid-Tier Team

1. After discussing about JSON parsing, we decided that we wanted to work
with survey.js' current implementation of using an entire survey JSON string
to display questions, as survey.js has built-in functionality to display
questions with ease.

2. Met with Joseph and parsed out how to engage with the assessment
controller. Joseph will focus on the functions to save the answers of the
assessment, while I will work on the scripts to insert and select the
surveys from the database.

3. Again, potentially difficult to meet with most of the group, but will
continue to work on the scripts until our mid-tier meeting on monday.
