Mid-Tier Team

1. Met with the mid-tier team about working on the assessment, narrowed
down our user stories to working on functions to insert/replace
answers, along with selecting surveys out of the DB.

2. Will continue to work on functionality, along with using Hans'
mock database to work with data.

3. Using PHP functions for Javascript seems a little tricky, but we
saw some AJAX support, will be continuing to look into integrating
AJAX for our functions.
