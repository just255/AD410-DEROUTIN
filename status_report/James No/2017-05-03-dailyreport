Mid-Tier Team

1. Met with the team (along with the whole team in our second sprint), saw the
mockups presented and what's ahead for mid-tier. Will continue to work on
the basic functionality for the editor and the assessment, which in this case
will be the insert statements. Niko wrote some scripts for REPLACE, will
talk with the group to see its functionality.

2. Plan to meet up with mid-tier on Thursday before class, Kari along with
Satoru from front-end and back-end are planning to join so we can
discuss where to go with the editor and its workload.

3. As we will be parsing JSON not for the assessment, but for the reports, will
be discussing the roadmap towards doing so. It would be either parsing answers
separately into its own database (which may be inefficient), or create scripts
for parsing a selected JSON file (which will have multiple scripts for).
