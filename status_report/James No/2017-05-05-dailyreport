Mid-Tier Team

1. Met with the mid-tier (and the whole team it turns out haha). Was great
having almost a second time to meet and discuss workflow, and we made good
progress in delegating certain tasks (back-end seemed to want more workload),
so we gave them the task of designing mock-databases using the JSON objects
that would be made from the mock-assessments. Talked with front-end about the
parsing scripts, and we will be working on them jointly when the time comes.

2. Will be working on ear-marking DIV containers in the editor, for which ones
we want to remove from the editor (in terms of extraneous functionality.)

3. Ghebre wrote a JSON parser function which we will continue to iterate with
our JSON objects. It will be the first step towards making the JSON object
usable for the reports.
