Mid-Tier Team

1. Had problems earmarking various div containers to take out for the editor,
as the scripts for the editor are called from online resources. Will have to
discuss making localized scripts & editing them to remove various
extraneous functionality.

2. Will meet with group today to discuss the next sprint, planning to elaborate
more on the ERD of the databases, along with creating cards on Trello for
each mid-tier member to have tasks to complete.

3. Only issue will be dealing with the implementation of localized scripts for
the editor.
