Mid-Tier Team

1. After having the Scrum session with the group and seeing front-end's
fantastic design, we will be working on the scripts for the controller.
Had a discussion with the group prior on Monday 5/08 about dividing the cards
up.

2. Working on the scripts that will send data to the admin dashboard.

3. Kari's project structure made a great example about how the data should
be returned to be usable by the front-end. Will be working to have a similar
output.
