Mid-Tier Team

1. Had a small group meeting with some of the mid-tier group, along with
Satoru from back-end. Also met with Mahilet at the grove earlier on Thursday,
5/11, and were discussing about integrating more work between back-end and
front end.

2. Still continuing to work on the scripts, they are just variants of eachother
asking for different values.

3. No current issues at the moment, just waiting to see it fully functional.
