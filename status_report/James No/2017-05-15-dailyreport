Mid-Tier Team

1. Was supposed to have a meeting today, but mid-tier moved the meeting time to
before class tomorrow. Will pool our work for the week and discuss about further
refinement.

2. Still continuing to work on the scripts, refining & tightening parts of the
scripts.

3. No current issues at the moment, just waiting to see it fully functional.
Hope to keep a consistent style with the others when meeting.
