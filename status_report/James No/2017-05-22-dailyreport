Mid-Tier Team

1. Met with Ghebre and Niko, discussing the controller/model pattern that
we will use for our scripts. Also wrote about it on the Slack channel, and Kari
was able to clarify more about utilizing AJAX scripts with the current
project structure.

2. Will plan to discuss on Tuesday the final minutes in getting the app
presentation-ready for Wednesday.

3. Hope that we can get everything finalized before Wednesday!
