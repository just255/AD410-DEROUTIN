Today

1. met with mid-tier team (James was only one present). fleshed out a plan for the current sprint. we are working on displaying quizes and saving the answers to database.
2. tested basic code to retrieve answers from a quiz. survey.js editor can save both quiz questions and their answers in separate json files. now the answers for each question can be displayed independent of the question itself. the answers have keys that reference the question they belong to.


Tomorrow (and Sunday)

1. will try to come up with working prototype for a load, save, and save as system in the editor for tuesday's class.
2. will also work on a system to display quizes for our current sprint.

Roadblock(s):

1. not everyone was able to attend our meeting this evening. I realize everyone has a life outside of school, but we meet maybe once a week outside of class, and only for about an hour. it would be REALLY nice if we could have a good, productive, 2 hour minimum meet and actually develop more strategies/plans to better contribute to the overall project. I feel mid-tier has been lacking in planning and coordination and would like to fix this.
2. on tuesday, our discussion of how questions are created, stored, displayed. i feel i did not explain how the surveyjs system of doing this works. i am still learning the system myself (made good progress in that front today). but i will try to come up with something to better explain this.
