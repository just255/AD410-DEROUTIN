Yesterday

Met with mid-tier, front end, and a few people from back end groups to discuss what to do next. based upon front end design, mid-tier will make functions to be used as filters for the reports. mid-tier came up with database scheme and back end will implement. back end will also import some dummy data into said database.

Today

added save functionality to the quiz view demo. this code can be re-used elsewhere as needed
