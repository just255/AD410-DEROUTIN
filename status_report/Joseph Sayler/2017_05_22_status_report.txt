Roadblocks

big roadblock i noticed is where do we put our files? all our scripts are in individual files (for the most part). and if i understand things right, we have to put them into controller files as functions? this definately needs to be covered tomorrow. i assume we want to have everything set up as it would be in production environment, and this is a big part of it.

also, where to put the db? just curious...
