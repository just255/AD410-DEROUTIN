1) Yesterday I worked on setting up the Laravel framework in our directory, as well as incorporating the code people wrote in with the new directory. 

2) Tomorrow I plan on putting together a Laravel reference doc for our weekly Scrum. 

3) Road blocks would be getting everyone on the same page with things. Hopefully we can hammer that out tommorow.
