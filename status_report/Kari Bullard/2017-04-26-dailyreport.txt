1) Yesterday I created site place holders with functioning navigation.

2) Today I worked on unifying mockups, and tomorrow we will review those mockups with Alessa to ensure we are heading in the direction they intend with functionality. As well as determine the must-haves vs. the nice-to-haves.

3) No roadblocks.
