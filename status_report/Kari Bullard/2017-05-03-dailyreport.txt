1) yesterday I went looked into implementing a datagrid using google charts that can be updated with ajax requests.

2) tomorrow I am attending a mid-tier meeting to discuss how we're planning on passing the data from us to them.

3) Roadblock: need to make dummy data, or get real data to populate database so we can start testing.
