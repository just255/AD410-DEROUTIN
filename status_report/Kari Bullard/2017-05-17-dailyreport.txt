1) Yesterday I worked with Suraj and Mark to get Oauth working on our live host.

2) Today I met with Olga to got over report information, and work on getting her local host setup, which has yet to happen, but we'll continue working on it. 

3) No roadblocks as of now, besides like, the known ones.
