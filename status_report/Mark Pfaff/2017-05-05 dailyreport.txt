Status Report 12:

1) What did you do?
* Spent five hours today trying to get laravel to display on a server. Can do it with localhost but not remote. Setup on my own domain and AWS Beanstalk. I can’t get it to display with Laravel. Apparently Laravel isn’t compatible with shared hosting and if you can install it it has to take over the entire root. That’s why I tried AWS but AWS is like setting up your own server


2) What are you doing next?
Checking status reports for roadblocks
checking in on team code

3)What roadblocks stand in your way?
Setting up laravel on remote host is a nightmare
