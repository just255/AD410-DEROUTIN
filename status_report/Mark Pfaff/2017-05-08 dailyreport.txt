Status Report 13:

1) What did you do?
* Tried again to setup Laravel on shared host using a restructuring hack then another attempt on AWS install to no avail
* Decided with Kari to gut laravel of the routing functionality so we’re just using php. That will make it more compatible with wherever we deploy 



2) What are you doing next?
* Meet with team:
   * Front, Mid, Back team updates
   * Plan for our first show and tell with the board on May 19th 12:30 – 1:30 pm
   * Walk through of Laravel ‘de-routing’ / restructuring the project
   * Troubleshooting git conflicts caused by project restructuring
* Check status reports
* Make sure Trello is up to date

3)What roadblocks stand in your way?
Need to get Kari’s update on Laravel to attempt install on a server
