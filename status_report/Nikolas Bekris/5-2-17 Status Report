1. Met with entire team. Discussed our survey.js editor.

2. Will be meeting with back end and front end thrusday to discuss ways to store the JSON object into our database.
I think we should just store the entire object then parse through the information we need once we take the object out of the
database. 

3. Will discuss further with group thursday.
