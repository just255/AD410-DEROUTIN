Status Report 13

1. Yesterday I worked on Android Projects. 

2. Today I'm taking a look at the DB Mahilet made, and seeing if I can make a DB revolving around that.

3. The biggest "set back" I'm facing right now is looking for direction of what to do next. I'm looking forward to the meeting tomorrow.
